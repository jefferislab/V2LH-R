## Preface

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.


## Intro

We would like to see what we can find out about the input to PNs suspected to
overlap with 

```{r}
lhon_overlap <- readRDS("data_val.rds")
library(knitr)
kable(lhon_overlap)
```


## ORN responses
```{r, fig.width=8}
library(DoOR.functions)
dplot_al_map("MQWCXKGKQLNYQG-UHFFFAOYSA-N", scalebar = T)
```

```{r, fig.width=8}
dplot_al_map("NMRPBPVERJPACX-UHFFFAOYSA-N", scalebar = T)
```
