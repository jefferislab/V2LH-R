## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Read in Data
```{r}
lhon_overlap <- readRDS("data_val.rds")
```

Let's pick 50% of total input as our threshold for interesting PNs

```{r}
# figure out 50% of distribution
threshold=sum(lhon_overlap$value)*0.50
lhon_overlap$cs=cumsum(lhon_overlap$value)
subset(lhon_overlap, cs<sum(lhon_overlap$value)*0.5)
```

So it turns out that all 6 inputs above that threshold are food. What's the likelihood
of that by random draw
```{r}
vv=replicate(10000,all(sample(lhon_overlap$BehaviouralSignificance, 6)=="Food"))
table(vv)
```
Low!
